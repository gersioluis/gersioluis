I am Sergio Trevisán; I'm currently studying engineering; I'd like to collaborate on developing projects.

I’m interested in Python, Java and d(lang).

You can reach me at elgersio.t@gmail.com (I have no IG, no FB, no pipiripipí -in spanish).

Fun facts: modular synthesis (music), flute, electronics, mathematics, poetry, food, love, samba and candombe.
